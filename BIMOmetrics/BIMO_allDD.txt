The assignment for this inspection stated to provide coverage for "A205676/001".  However, the firm was not aware of this product and I was informed by firm's owner that they have not performed any analysis for this product. CDER was contacted. .
The decision to downgrade the final classification to VAI was made because while regulatory violations exist, they do not have a significant impact on data integrity or the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
The firm no longer handles HCT/Ps.  Make firm Inspectional Obligation NO for human tissue PAC codes.
The firm was classified "Referred to Center" with a Withhold recommendation for the 46832 PAC, because the firm was not ready for inspection.  The firm will need to be inspected upon their readiness before approval of the addition of this new site.
The information obtained during the inspection from this site confirms the study data from this site was not adequate and well controlled and the review division has rejected the study data.
There is no manufacture, storage, testing, or shipment of commercial products for the U.S. market.
The sponsor is not using this site.
The violations noted during the inspection do not have a significant impact on data integrity on the rights, safety, or welfare of the study subjects.  A t-con was held w/ the field on 03/26/20106 to discuss the change in the classification.
